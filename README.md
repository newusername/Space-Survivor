KNOWN ISSUES
============

TODO
====
- Improve the assets
  - add a basic ship (use some existing image)
  - add an asteroid
- Implement movement system
  - no instant rotation, but gradually.
  - Inertia based movement? 
  - The exact properties/ behaviour depends on the Engine?
    - e.g. different max speed and how fast the ship rotates.
  - Two types of drives. 
    - Main thruster: powerful, but can only move straight ahead
    - Maneuvering thrusters: much weaker. Can be used to rotate the ship and produce momentum in arbitrary directions.
- Weapons!
- Sound!
- Upgrade System
- Write a proper ReadMe
