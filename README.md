## Game Manual

### Controls
- There are two types of drives. 
  - Main thruster: powerful, but can only move straight ahead
  - Maneuvering thrusters: much weaker, but can be directed in any direction.

## KNOWN ISSUES
- All good :D

## immediate todo
- All Done :D

## TODO
- Improve the optics
  - add thruster animation for main thruster and maneuvering thrusters 
- Improve movement system
  - Allow rotation to go the longer angle, if that would be faster due to having momentum in the direction of the long angle.
- Weapons!
- Sound!
- Upgrade System
- Implement a more general Input system that does not rely on my setup.
- Write a proper ReadMe
