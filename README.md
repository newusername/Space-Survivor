Space Survivor - Very early stage...
==============================

You are just a tiny ship in an environment full of perils. Survive!

## What is this game?
- short introduction to what the game is about + some screenshots?
Sections coming soon :D:

## How to install?
I recommend to clone this repository and use uv to install the required packages.
Follow these steps:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/newusername/Space-Survivor.git`
2. Navigate into the top level directory of the cloned  repository.
3. Open a terminal and run `uv sync`. (Only the first time or after updating.)
4. Then start the game with `uv run main.py`.

## Game Manual

Currently, there is only a minigame available which is more of a tech demo testing the physics engine.

Your goal is simple, dodge the asteroids and don't get squashed! (Well there is no damage yet, so have fun pushing asteroids instead if you like :D)

### Controls
Moving:
- There are two types of drives. 
  - Main thruster: powerful, but can only move straight ahead (R2)
  - Maneuvering thrusters: much weaker, but can be directed in any direction. (Left stick for moving and right stick for rotating.)
- Your ships board computer can take over to stabilize the ship and stop both rotation and movement using the maneuvering thrusters. (R1)

Misc:
- Press the sticks to zoom in or out.

## KNOWN ISSUES
- all done :D
